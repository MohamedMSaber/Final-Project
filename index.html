                    culinary elements. Koshary is made of rice, macaroni, and lentils mixed together,[2] topped with a
                    spiced tomato sauce
                    and garlic vinegar and garnished with chickpeas and crispy fried onions.

                    <h3>Molokhiya</h3>
                    Molokhiya is a green, leafy vegetable which is chopped and cooked in stews with beef, chicken and
                    rabbit,
                    and normally served on a bed of white rice with a side of bread. The vegetable has a distinct,
                    bitter flavour not unlike okra,
                    and turns silky in texture when boiled or fried. In coastal areas, molokhiya is used to wrap up
                    seafood before grilling,
                    infusing the fish with delicious, aromatic flavour.

                    <h3>Fatta</h3>
                    A traditional Nubian dish which originates from ancient religious ceremonies, fatta consists of
                    layers of fried rice and bread,
                    topped with tomato sauce, vinegar and meat broth normally made from sheep or cow brains. Though
                    delicious,
                    the dish is considered too complex and fattening for an everyday meal,so is normally reserved for
                    special occasions and religious festivals.
                    Many restaurants serve fatta, however, so you should have no problem finding it during your visit.

                    <h3>Hawawshi</h3>
                    Another street food favourite and must-try savoury delicacy, hawawshi is a type of turnover pastry
                    dish,
                    filled with minced lamb or beef, and marinated with pepper, parsley, chilli and onions. Similar to
                    the Middle Eastern lahmacun,
                    hawawshi consists of two round pieces of dough, pressed together around the filling and baked until
                    golden brown.
                    The dish is commonly made at home by working-class Egyptian families, and is also served as a
                    popular street food,
                    particularly in Alexandria and Cairo.

                    <h3>Bamia</h3>
                    Originally hailing from the Middle East, bamia is a rich stew cooked with okra, tomatoes and spices,
                    and served alongside bread, rice and salad. The Egyptian variety usually contains cuts of lamb,
                    which turn deliciously soft and tender over the long cooking time of the stew. Egyptians also add
                    ta’aleya,
                    a type of garlic cooking sauce, to enhance the flavours of the dish, as well as coriander, cardamom
                    and onion.
                    Bamia is actually the Arabic word for okra, one of the key ingredients of this rich and tasty dish.
